During our graduating year, a group of students were approached by the faculty to assist in a project in collaboration with the Australian Government's Department of Health. This project was to research ways to alleviate stress in the hospital.
You can check out the final solution [here](https://youtu.be/Yx6J1pdz-AQ).

### Aim

As a part of the project, our aim was to provide design solutions to alleviate stress for Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) Nurses in Australia.

### Solution

The core user problem we discovered was the 'double edged sword' of a Nurses Empathy. Because they cared so much for their paitients, they devoted little time to their own emotional wellbeing which led. We devised a system to automate the monitoring of their own wellbeing, alert support services and allow VAD nurses to continue focusing on their important work.

### Team

In a team of three, we shared the roles of user research, conceptual design, system mockups and presentation. With a shared skill set, we were able to complete these tasks efficiently. With the access to existing research and the ability to have conversations with VAD nurses from all over Australia, we were able to devise a design solution that effectively addressed discovered user needs.

### Design Process

Using conversations and previous transcripts, we drew insights in the form of an affinity diagram.

This brought us to our problem areas which were reframed as user needs to guide conceptual design. we developed three concepts varying according to cost, the use of physical space and methods of community building.

We consulted transcripts that went through a nurses day to compile a user journey map. From the touchpoints established we formed the basis where solutions could alleviate stress in terms of time.

The first concept was a respite room nurses could use to quickly destress at work. While suited to other high stress situations, this was considered a concept that wouldn't be appreciated as Nurses felt they'd be too focused on the patients while at work to organise a session.

The second concept was a common room expansion in which relaxing element would be included in a nurses environment. While supported the funds required could not justify it's implementation as Nurses weren't sure that by having these elements in their common room, stressed would be alleviated.

The third concept was a digital board added to the common room where nurses could book sessions with support services quickly and easily. While an interesting concept, the cost of technology was too high to justify what could be accomplished with existing technology. VAD nurses also felt the technology would have to be intuitive and integrate into their workflow.

This feedback helped us understand we needed something that integrates into current technology and a Nurses existing routine as seamlessly as possible. We initially considered wearables and compared products to understand the underlying common themes. Upon feedback, it was discovered that wearables would interfere with a Nurse work but we felt the feedback system could be utilised in another capacity.

This led to a software based approach with feedback being captured through emotional recognition software for Nurses who chose to opt-in. This was supported as it maintained the benefits of a feedback system for stress alleviation without causing any interference in a Nurse's usual workflow. At our graduation the team was awarded the HCI award for excellence in service design.
