The library was approached by the faculty of arts and social sciences (FASS) to create an addition to the curriculum for a course. This course was based around learning effective Interdisciplinary collaboration: learning how to conduct effective research alongside people with different educational backgrounds.

### Aim

We needed to create content that would encourage students to participate and provide them with clear instructional strategy to understand the main objectives of the assessments, how that was divided into weekly tasks and subtasks and the value of what they could learn through this process.

### Solution

We created an assessment brief, an introductory video explaining the concept of their assessments and documentation to guide their work. This synergised the knowledge acquired through their knowledge mapping essay into their collaborative presentation.

### Team

This was conducted in collaboration with members the FASS Faculty as subject matter experts. We created the materials according our the principles of epistemology and iterated the design artefacts according to their feedback.

### Design Process

We took precedents from existing design literature as we had experience in applying these principles to collaborative environments.

This was simplified into a set of steps that could be applied to collaborative epistemological contexts.

These steps were then applied to the specific context of the FASS3999 course
