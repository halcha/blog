### Thanks

For the past year, I've been working on a design disseration about collaborative systems in online learning. It's been an amazing experience. I'd like to thank my Supervisor, Dr Kazjon Grace, my partner in design crime Brittany Klassens and the Research Team of Dr Liam Bray, Alex Elton-Pym, Harrison McEwan and Rob Dongas. Without our intrepid band of adventurers braving the wilds of online learning, this speck of stardust in the collective enormity of human progress would not be the way it is.
