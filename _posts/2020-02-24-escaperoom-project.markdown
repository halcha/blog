The University of Sydney Library was hosting Welcome Week at the beginning of Semester One this year. Every year, students are invited to explore the library to get a feel of how it works and how they can effectively use the library during their degree. We wanted to make this experience inviting for students who weren't naturally interested in exploring the library.
You can check out the web page [here on GitHub](https://usyd-risu.github.io/escape_room/escape_room_2020/). Answers are at the bottom of this post.

### Aim
We needed to Increase interest in the library by better promoting the benefits of understanding the hidden treasures of knowledge and history in an inviting context. The solution also needed to fit the theme of welcome week 'Curiouser and Curiouser'.

### Solution
![inistu shots at library escape room 2020](/blog/assets/images/insitu-escape.png)
We designed and developed a web site that let students transform the entire library into an escape room. By following the instructions and solving the riddles they could complete the task set out for them on a mobile first web page.

### Team
There was a team of two working on narrative, design and development. We were supported by Academic Liason Librarians (ALLs) who provided expert knowledge of the space and sage advice on creating this experience to complement the existing activities of welcome week. With a team of two, we worked the project collaborative, exponentially increasing our efficiency through effective communication and task management.

### Design Process

We began the process with a script, collaborating with ALLs who leveraged their knowledge of the space and trivia for the event to guide our writing process.

As the script developed, we discovered a variety of character's from Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland' (1865) would provide engaging guides to give each riddle a greater depth of immersion.

As we tested the experience with some volunteers before the launch, we realised it wouldbe quite crowded if everyone started from the same point. As such, we built in a randomiser script on the website so people would start from different points in activity, collect everything they need and then unlock the final challenge.

We thought people would mostly be using the website from a mobile or tablet device. Because of this, we focused our designs to be mobile first. We also wanted to keep the interactions simple so students could focus their attention on exploring the library and use the website to augment that experience.

### Promotion
To put the webpage somewhere quickly and easily, we hosted it on GitHub. you can check out the web page [here](https://usyd-risu.github.io/escape_room/escape_room_2020/)
