CoreData is a global market research consultancy. They were looking to create a network that lets product managers understand which financial advisers were interested in their product. They brought me on to help figure out this could be done.

### Aim
The network consisted of multiple dimensions that product managers needed to interact with to find the niche for their product. The aim was to provide a medium between product managers and the network that was efficient, intuitive and accessible

### Solution
We designed and developed a webapp that organises financial advisers into groups based on what products they’d be interested in. We wanted this webapp to fit in with a product managers workflow. User Testing and Design iteration based on feedback was the foundation of the design process.

### Team
There was a team of four working on data analysis, design and app development. My roles were distilling user needs into actionable design heuristics, creating the design language for the app, mapping user interaction to information architecture and developing the landing page.

### Design Process

To keep track of ideas and potential avenues we used a miro board along the way. This gave us a conceptual framework free from visualisation to think about the goal from it’s core ideas.

To give the development phase a visual anchor we mocked up the site in figma and prepared click through prototypes for client meetings and and user evaluation research.

We developed an experimental mockup to get feedback quickly

It also worked as a great space to work out user flow through diagramming.

To get this feedback, interviews, think aloud and over the shoulder sessions were set up between SMEs and designers. This gave us a better feel for why nuances in the design needed tweaking or worked great.

Through this feedback, we came to a design that satisfied the business objectives and met user needs.

### Promotion
To promote Anubis Data, we set up a website and created a promotional video explaining what the webapp is and how it works.
