Recently I’ve been mulling over the difference between what we often refer to as everyday thinking and meditating.

To me, one is doing something and the other is doing neither something nor nothing; you’re not doing it but you’re also not not doing it.

The beauty of both situations is that there is nothing to either. In getting things done you just do it and in understanding reality you’re just not doing it while not not doing it.

Perhaps one of the problems with procrastination is that people conflate speaking and thinking the language of preparing to get something done with the language of getting something done. These are two ways of being on an equal level of doing something. The former simply makes people feel like they deserve/are ready/are motivated to do the latter. There’s not a requirement of the former to exist at all.

This could be why the zen buddhists cultivated spontaneous action. Through a cessation of rumination and preparation they understood the equanimity of all action and that preparation, while effective at prediction in parameters, does not dictate success.

If we assume there is a correlation between preparation and success, this begs the question: is success part of objective reality? If we assume the ego is not and is a social convention for convenience, I would argue success also lies in this category.

But I digress. We are pondering the correlation of preparation and success. And since this is conjecture I will continue to throw ideas into the void. I propose that spontaneity is more correlated with success as an ideal than preparation because this is more in tune with the natural world. Darwinism states that survival of the fittest is the law of nature. However, this can only be determined after the fact. A judgement is made after a test of strength between agents of combat with survival as the metric for success.

Using this scenario as a guide, I would propose that spontaneity includes preparation on a subconscious level. The successful agents combine the lessons of past encounters into their spontaneous action without what seems to be conscious will. Preparation is only of use when it moves with spontaneous action and not in dissonance.

If we assume that preparation is only successful when spontaneous we can, for a lack of a better term, refer to this as unconscious preparation.

It is this unconscious preparation within spontaneity that implies success and an interference of conscious preparation that implies a lack thereof.

I hope you enjoyed this nonsense. If you're interested in more, check out me and my mate Moo's twitch channel; it a lot of the same but with video games. Check it out [here](https://www.twitch.tv/teabrews/schedule)
