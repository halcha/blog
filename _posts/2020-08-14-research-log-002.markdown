This week, I’ve been working on the design for the challenge recipe - a guide for students to make p5.js puzzles for other students.

There are three parts to this. The Recipe, the example and the components.

The recipe is the main guide. It’s got the special sauce of pedagogical goodness gathered from research, interviews with experts and searching through the old tomes of good teaching.

The example is my crack at following these steps. It’s puts the recipe into practice to give a bit of context to the concepts talked about in the recipe

The components explain on a more practical basis what html elements have been used in the example and how they work.

I think there’s a missing bit; a starter page for students where they can place the components. I guess we’ll add that moving forward.

There’s also going to be a bit of research on this. Asking past students for their thoughts on this system for teaching code. But we’ll talk about that next time.
